        <h1>A Handmade Web ◡̈</h1>
        <h3>J. R. Carpenter, March 2015.</h3>

        <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a
'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run.
For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers
have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting,
and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers.
In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called Unindexed which continuously
searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was
permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the source code on GitHub, so you too can
create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it.
Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfort’s Taroko Gorge (2008). For
many, this was their first experience 'making' a computer-generated text.
I have rewritten Taroko Gorge three times. Further to the close relation between the handmade
web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output and source code from the first
iteration, Gorge (2010), were published in my very small press print
book GENERATION[S] (2010), which, I believe, is now only available as a PDF. Gorge is a
never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms
on food, consumption, decadence, and desire.</p>

        <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention to the physical body.
Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock's The One Mile
Scroll (2008) A few entries appear at the top of the screen - Denver, The Mile High City - my
grandfather’s grave, Denver - after that we scroll and scroll. The hand is made to work. Through
the labour of the body the virtual space of the browser window is transformed into an actual,
physical distance.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="p3">
        <p>Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web. In Reading Writing
Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound (2014), Lori Emerson argues: "The iPad works
because users can’t know how it works" (15). Reading the web on an iPhone, iPad, or similar
device, readers do not have the option of viewing the page source. The iPad provides
consumers with access to materials created by others, but cannot easily be used as a tool in the
handcrafting of new materials.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="p4">
        <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of
resistance. In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications,
read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and
digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish
experimental web art and writing projects.The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I
am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways.</p>
