        <h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
        <p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define
the web of this period. In her essay, A Vernacular Web (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and
personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connectionand a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts. For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent research on the amateur web, see: One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent.</p>
        <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web
pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.
I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for Fishes & Flying Things came from the
material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art
exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to
tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that’s the way
books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and
round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The
QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of
which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still
works.</p>
    
        <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
relationship. This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at
Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
influential online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a word-processed
photocopied booklet which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
trAce’s last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
about the use of mixed media in writing... The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce
Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. (PDF trAces: A
Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce, page 14)</p>
        <p>One of the many interesting things about the online archive of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere —
manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom
— the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium
within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to
change.</p>
